Pull requests are very welcome. Please follow the same coding style already set within the Base files and keep commits as clean as possible with a detailed explanation of what your pull request is doing.

The Base website is maintained through the `gh-pages` branch. Experimental or major new features will split out into separate branches.

If you make any additions to the framework appropriate updates to the website are appreciated.
